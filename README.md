Project Synapse Core is a health tracking app that:

1. Lets users easily log their daily health information:
   - How they feel (mood)
   - Stress levels
   - Sleep quality
   - Physical activity
   - Any symptoms they notice

2. Shows this information in simple charts that are easy to understand

3. Uses basic AI to spot patterns in their health data:
   - "Your mood seems better on days you sleep more"
   - "Your stress has been higher than usual lately"

## Why It Matters for Autonome

This project can help Autonome in important ways:

### 1. Collect Data You're Missing

- While your system uses wearables and medical tests, some important health information can only come from what people tell us
- Feelings, stress, and personal symptoms are hard to measure with devices alone
- This app collects this missing data in a fun way people will actually use

### 2. Keep People Engaged While Waiting

- People on your waitlist can use this now, before they get access to the full Autonome system
- They start building health habits and seeing the value of tracking
- When they get the full Autonome system, they'll already understand the benefits

### 3. Start Finding Patterns Right Away

- The app's simple AI shows the value of health tracking immediately
- Users see connections between their habits and how they feel
- This builds trust in Autonome's more advanced predictions later

### 4. Easy to Add to Your System

- Built with simple technology that works reliably
- Data can be easily moved into your main system
- Can be branded to match Autonome's look and feel

## How We Can Work Together

1. **Start Simple**: Offer this to people on your waitlist as an "Autonome Companion"
2. **Gather Insights**: Learn what keeps users engaged with health tracking
3. **Grow Together**: Eventually move these features directly into your main platform
